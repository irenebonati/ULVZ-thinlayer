# ULVZ-thinlayer
This repository contains the code analyzing the dynamics of ultralow-velocity zones (ULVZs) in the lower mantle. This work was published as Hernlund and Bonati (2019): "Modeling Ultralow Velocity Zones as a Thin Chemically Distinct Dense Layer at the Core-Mantle Boundary" in the journal JGR:Solid Earth.
